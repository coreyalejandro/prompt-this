### Creating Custom Workflows

#### Planning Your Workflow

##### 1. Define Your Goal

- What do you want to accomplish?
- What's the expected final output?
- How complex is the task?

##### 2. Break Down the Process

- What are the logical steps?
- Which agents are best for each step?
- What dependencies exist between steps?

##### 3. Choose Agent Sequence

- Start simple (2-3 agents)
- Consider which provider works best for each step
- Plan how results will flow between agents

#### Workflow Design Examples

##### Research Analysis Workflow

```text
Step 1: RAG Agent

- Provider: Anthropic

Step 2: Chain-of-Thought Agent  
- Prompt: "Provide detailed methodology analysis"
- Depends on: Step 1
- Provider: OpenAI

Step 3: Factuality Checker
- Prompt: "Verify the claims and conclusions"
- Depends on: Step 2
- Provider: Anthropic
```

##### Creative Writing Workflow

```text
Step 1: Tree-of-Thoughts Agent
- Prompt: "Generate story ideas for: [theme]"
- Provider: OpenAI

Step 2: Zero-Shot Agent
- Prompt: "Write a short story based on the best idea"
